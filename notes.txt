Ideas:

visual representation of beam

adjust width of columns in tree widget

maybes:

default text in dialog boxes?

remove interactions by right clicking?

add beam status box: length, number of each type of interaction, number on knowns/ unknowns, solvable, etc.

later:

distribution (py to exe, others?)

Current work:

need to reset the visualizer when a new beam is created, or cleared
