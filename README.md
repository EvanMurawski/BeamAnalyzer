**License:** MIT

**Version:** v0.2.0

**Description:**

A program in Python3 to statically analyze beams. This program is a work in progress. It currently has the capability to solve statically determinate beams with point forces and moments, and plot the shear and moment diagram. Currently not well tested. Works using the text based UI contained in: textinterface.py

**Dependencies:**


- numpy
- cmd2
- tabulate
- matplotlib
- pyqt4
